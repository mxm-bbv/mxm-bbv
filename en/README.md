# About Me

My name is **Maxim**. I'm 19 years old and I've completed 11 grades. I'm currently studying at college, having completed 11th grade, and I'm in my second year. I'm an experienced full-stack developer with over three years' experience in building web applications and business solutions. I specialise in building resilient and robust applications that effectively solve user problems and deliver business value. Thanks to my skills in both frontend and backend development, I can implement turnkey projects from database architecture to user interface implementation.

## Key skills

## Front-end development

I specialize in creating fast and error-free user interfaces that are not only user-friendly but also visually appealing. Here are the details of my skills:

### Working with Vue.js and Nuxt.js

I actively use **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js** for frontend development, which allows me to create dynamic interfaces and intuitive web applications. My experience in this area includes:

- **Vue 3 and Composition API**: Confident use of Composition API to write modular code that is easy to extend and maintain.
- **Component Approach**: Create reusable and easily replaceable components while adhering to clean code principles.
- **State Management**: Using **Pinia** to centrally manage application state to ensure proper data handling.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Customize routes using Vue Router to create different pages and nested routes, which improves the structure and navigation of the application.

### Using CSS and SCSS

SCSS allows me to write structured and reusable code. My skills in this area include:

- **Adaptive Design**: Using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create adaptive interfaces that display optimally on all devices.
- **BEM Methodology**: Using BEM for class naming, making styling modular and easily extensible.
- **ScSS Blends and Variables**: Using blends and variables to simplify styling and ensure consistency across the site.

### Animations and UI Libraries

Animations and effects greatly enhance the user experience:

- Using CSS animations and libraries such as **Animate.css** to create more lively interfaces.
- Using UI libraries (e.g. Vuetify, Element UI) to quickly create quality interfaces while choosing customized solutions for unique designs.

### API Integration

My experience with the backend allows me to efficiently organize the interaction between the frontend and the server:

- Using **Axios** and Vue's built-in methods to send requests and retrieve data.
- Customizing error handling and caching to improve application performance and fault tolerance.
- Optimizing APIs to minimize load and maximize UI responsiveness.

### Performance Optimization

Fast UI is the key to a great user experience:

- Applying **lazy load** to components and images to reduce load times.
- Minimizing and compressing JavaScript and CSS files using Gulp/Webpack.
- Customizing code separation and using only necessary libraries to reduce the weight of the final build file.

### HTML5 and accessibility

I work confidently with HTML5 and always consider accessibility:

- Semantic markup is important for both SEO and usability for users with special needs.
- Ensuring accessibility for all categories of users using ARIA attributes and testing on different devices.

### Development and debugging tools

I use a wide range of tools to quickly identify and fix bugs:

- **DevTools** in Chrome and Firefox for testing and debugging.
- Compilation and minification using Gulp/Webpack to speed up the application.

## Back-end development

The bulk of my backend development experience is with PHP and Laravel. This framework allows me to quickly build powerful and flexible applications to solve complex business problems. My skills include:

### Experience with Laravel

I use Laravel to develop server-side logic, handle requests, and create RESTful APIs. My experience with Laravel includes:

- Developing and implementing backend applications, including creating and implementing Laravel APIs.
- Forming a robust application architecture, including setting up models, controllers, services, middlewares, and obverses.
- Applying Eloquent ORM for efficient database operations.
- Implementing service providers and middleware to increase flexibility and application logic.
- Developing a RESTful API with support for HTTP and JSON standards, and customizing authentication with tokens (e.g. Laravel Passport or Sanctum).

### Working with databases

I have extensive experience working with MySQL and other relational databases:

- Designing and normalizing database structures, effectively managing relationships between tables.
- Optimizing queries and creating complex selections using Eloquent ORM or SQL queries.
- Migration and customization of SIDs for database management and consistent updates.

### Integration with APIs and external services

I create integrations with external APIs using complex request and response processing, such as integrations with banking APIs for insurance calculation or other financial services. I use OAuth2 to securely authenticate and authorize users through third-party services.

### Working with WebSocket and Centrifugo

I also have experience with **WebSocket** and **Centrifugo**, which allows me to build real-time and interactive applications. My skills in this area include:

- **WebSocket**: Using WebSocket to implement two-way communication between client and server to provide instant data updates and improve user experience.
- **Centrifugo**: Integrating Centrifugo into projects to create scalable, real-time applications, making it easy to manage connections and user interactions.

These technologies help me build more dynamic and responsive applications, improving user interaction and overall project functionality.

### Security and Performance

I pay a lot of attention to application security and performance:

- Validating all server-side data to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Implementing protection against CSRF attacks and utilizing secure password storage methods.
- Optimize performance through query caching, database optimization, and load balancing.

### Using DevOps practices for automation

Knowledge of DevOps helps me deploy and manage server-side components of an application:

- Containerization using Docker and Docker Compose to simplify deployment.
- CI/CD: Setting up continuous integration and delivery using tools like GitLab CI and Bamboo.

### Working with file storage and queues

I use file storage systems like S3 and Laravel local storage to manage files. I also use queues (such as Laravel Queues) to perform heavy tasks asynchronously.

### Logging and monitoring

I use Laravel Telescope to monitor application performance in real time, which helps in debugging and improving performance.

### DevOps.

I have experience with Docker and Docker Compose, including configuring and monitoring servers using Portainer.

#### Project Management Systems

I use Jira and Trello to effectively manage tasks and track project progress.

### Work Experience and Projects

Over the course of my career, I have been involved in building a variety of projects ranging from small web applications to large, highly loaded systems. My experience includes both team development and independent work:

- **[Finance.kz](https://finance.kz/)**: Loan matching platform. Development and finalization of functionality for the project, working with both backend and frontend. Integration with the bank's API to calculate the cost of car insurance and development of a PHP package for this task, available on GitHub.

- **[Domestic Violence Support Center](https://zhbn-pomosh-kunaev.kz/)**: I developed this project from scratch, including designing the interface and implementing the backend logic. The project included a secure data collection and processing system to help those in need.

- **CLOUD is an anonymous file storage**: As part of a test assignment, I developed a service that allows users to upload files without registering. The backend was on Laravel, the frontend was on Vue 3, with support for IP authentication and a RESTful API.

My experience spans the entire development cycle, from ideation to testing and support.

My approach to work is based on attention to detail, continuous self-improvement and adherence to professional standards. I believe the key to successful projects lies in careful planning, transparent communication and a commitment to improvement.

- **Responsibility and results-oriented**: I am always determined to complete a project, whether it's developing new features or fixing bugs.
  
- **Adaptability and Curiosity**: I adapt easily to new technologies and requirements, constantly striving to learn new development techniques and improve my skills.

- **Teamwork and Communication**: I am an active team player, openly sharing ideas and striving to create a productive atmosphere.
